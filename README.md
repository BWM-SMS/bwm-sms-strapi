# Note
1. For local development, we'll be utilizing SQLite for testing purposes, which won't impact the staging environment (which is postgres db). 
2. In the staging environment, we'll operate in production build mode. This setting will lock the CMS feature, preventing schema edits. Conversely, in the development environment, we'll run in development mode, enabling the CMS feature and allowing us to edit and test its functionalities.
3. Commit the code into the `develop` branch and create PR to `master` branch for review and merge.
